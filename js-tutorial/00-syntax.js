// Javascript is a language that evolves pretty quickly. Usually the Problem is the browsers which are not
// up-to-date with the latest features. However, because we are using node.js (server-side), we have access
// to all the features currently in the Chrome-V8 engine.

// Declare a variable:

let y = 0;

// Declare a function:

let myFunction = (arg) => {
    // body
}; // This is called a "big-arrow" function. It is mostly the same as a regular function() {}, but the scoping is
// slightly different. In general, big-arrow functions behave more like those known from other programming languages.
